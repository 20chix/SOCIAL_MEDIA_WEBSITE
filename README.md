# SOCIAL_MEDIA_WEBSITE
This is a project that was conducted based on the social media website explored in 
Robin's Nixon book "Learning PHP, MySQL &amp; JavaScript With jQuery, CSS & HTML5". 
This project was conducted for the sole purpose of expanding knowledge in the web development field,
and pushing the boundaries of what we have learned so far in PHP, mySQL, Jquery, Javascript, html and CSS
